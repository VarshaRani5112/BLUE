Part 2
Write test cases for the Experience  - Mailing an excel sheet to Sri for the scenario report been automated, tested manually, passed and failed
Part 3
Automate Test cases for the Experience
Utilize Cypress.-- Automated all the scenarios as possible --Task left (code optimisation,creation of fixtures and commands instaed of repeated codes)
Provide instructions on how to run automated tests - Open the test runner and click on the spec file this will run the code on test runner 
Alertnatively you can also type "npx cypress run" in cli to run it in command prompt 
Provide test results - Manual test results have been added in excel - tried integrating mochawsome report because of my machine dependency it is not supporting have created a json file for 
the report conversion to html will take a few more steps 

NOTE: USED BDD framework with cypress to automate the code
Added useful comments for the team for better understanding.
